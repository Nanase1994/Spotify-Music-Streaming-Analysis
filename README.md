B03 — Spotify Music Streaming Analysis

This project examines how audio characteristics, artist information, and geographic listening patterns interact to shape streaming performance on Spotify. Using country-level Top 200 daily charts merged with Spotify track-level audio features, we construct an integrated dataset that enables the analysis of temporal and cross-market streaming behaviors.

The workflow includes extensive data cleaning, normalization of track and artist identifiers, deduplication of chart entries, and the creation of an analysis-ready table linking streams, chart positions, and audio attributes. Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations, the study highlights global and regional differences in listener preferences, trends in high-performing tracks, and the distribution of audio feature profiles across markets.

The findings show meaningful variation in energy, valence, danceability, and tempo across countries, as well as strong concentration dynamics where a small number of tracks dominate total streams. By analyzing weekly and monthly patterns, the project documents how track popularity evolves over time and how audio features correlate with chart success at the aggregate level.

By integrating chart performance with audio characteristics and adopting geospatial and temporal analytics, the project provides insights into global music consumption behavior, cross-country listening diversity, and the structural patterns underlying Spotify streaming ecosystems.
